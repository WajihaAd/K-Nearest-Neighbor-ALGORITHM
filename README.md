# K-Nearest-Neighbor-ALGORITHM
Hereâ€™s a brief description of the parameters for KNeighborsClassifier:

 * n_neighbors: Number of neighbors to use for classification. Default is 5.

* weights: Function to weight the contributions of neighbors. Options are 'uniform' (all neighbors have equal weight) or 'distance' (closer neighbors have more weight). You can also pass a custom function. Default is 'uniform'.

* algorithm: Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors. Options are 'auto' (automatically chooses the best algorithm), 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', or 'brute'. Default is 'auto'.

* leaf_size: Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree. It affects the speed of the algorithm and memory usage. Default is 30.

* p: Power parameter for the Minkowski distance metric. Default is 2 (which corresponds to Euclidean distance). If set to 1, it uses Manhattan distance.

* metric: Distance metric to use for the tree. Default is 'minkowski', but you can specify other metrics like 'euclidean', 'manhattan', etc.

* metric_params: Additional keyword arguments for the distance metric function. Default is None.

* n_jobs: Number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search. Default is None (uses a single thread).

* n_jobs: Controls the number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing during the neighbor search.

If n_jobs=-1, it uses all available cores.
If n_jobs=None, it uses a single core.
Setting n_jobs to a higher value (e.g., the number of physical cores in your machine) can speed up the computation, especially with large datasets.
